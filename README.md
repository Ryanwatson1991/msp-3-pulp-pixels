# Pages & Pixels - Review & discuss your favourite books
[My deployed project is avaliable here](http://msp-3-pulp-pixels.herokuapp.com/get_index)

## What is the site?
A book review website where content is user generated. The website intends to be a community for book readers to be able to share 
their opinions on their favourite books by uploading reviews, as well as to allow users to discuss their favourite books by adding to review opinions 
through user comments. 

## What does the site aim to achieve?
The purpose of the website is to allow book lovers to express their thoughts on their favourite books, read other's thoughts on their favourite 
(or maybe not so favourite) books and to be able to take part in community discussion of these books via the user comments section
 on each review. 

Aditionally, the site is intended to earn the site owner money through purchase links to the book being reviewed.
